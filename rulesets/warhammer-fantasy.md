# PART III: CORRUPTION SYSTEM

Central mechanic for Warhammer — Chaos corruption.

## Corruption Scale

```
CORRUPTION: ●●○○○○○○○○ (2/10)

0: Pure — untouched by Chaos
1-2: Tainted — minor exposure, no effects yet
3-4: Marked — dreams, whispers, minor physical signs
5-6: Corrupted — visible mutations, madness risk
7-8: Damned — major mutations, Chaos gods notice you
9: Lost — NPC or roll new character
10: Spawn — become Chaos Spawn (death)
```

## Gaining Corruption

```
EXPOSURE:
+1: Prolonged time in Chaos Wastes
+1: Using Dark Magic / Warpstone
+1: Contact with Daemon
+1: Reading forbidden texts
+1: Chaos ritual (witnessed)
+2: Chaos ritual (participated)
+1: Breaking sacred oath
+1: Major sin by your god's standards

TEMPTATION (Chaos offers power):
Accept gift → gain power + corruption
Refuse → no corruption but lose the offer

MUTATIONS:
At Corruption 3+: GM rolls on mutation table when corruption increases
Mutation can be hidden (internal) or visible
```

## Reducing Corruption

```
DIFFICULT but possible:

-1: Holy site pilgrimage + ritual cleansing
-1: Great deed for Order god
-1: Witch Hunter/Priest exorcism (painful, risky)
-2: Grail Chapel (Bretonnia) — if Lady accepts
-1: Dwarfen rune of warding (expensive)

CANNOT reduce below your mutation count.
If you have 3 mutations, minimum corruption = 3.

BREAKING THE FLOOR:
- Removing a mutation (legendary ritual/quest) reduces minimum by 1
- Reputation 0 recovery: Redemption quest (DC 15 CHA) restores to 1
- Grail Quest, Slann intervention, or similar legendary acts can break limits
```

## Mutation Table (d20)

```
Roll when corruption increases at 3+:

1-5: Hidden (internal) — no visible sign
     Examples: extra organ, disturbing dreams, hear whispers

6-10: Concealable — can hide with effort
      Examples: scales on torso, third eye on chest, clawed hand

11-15: Visible — obvious to observers
       Examples: horns, tail, wrong-colored skin, extra limb

16-18: Major — significant transformation
       Examples: beast legs, tentacle arm, face change

19-20: Beneficial? — roll again, but gain +1 to one stat
       The gift has a price...

If same mutation twice: it intensifies or spreads.

MUTATION AGENCY (OPTIONAL):
Player chooses visibility tier (hidden/concealable/visible).
GM determines specific mutation within that category.
```

```

## Spellcasting

```
CASTING ROLL: d20 + INT + Wind Affinity (0 untrained, +2 trained, +4 master)
vs DC (simple 10, standard 15, powerful 18, legendary 22)

SPELL SYSTEM: Narrative-driven. Wizards can attempt any effect
fitting their Wind. GM sets DC based on scope/power.
No spell slots — risk is Miscast and Corruption.

MISCASTS:
Natural 1-2: Minor miscast (d6 table)
Natural 1 + failure by 5+: Major miscast (d10 table)

MINOR MISCAST (d6):
1: Stunned 1 round
2: Take d6 damage
3: Spell fires at wrong target
4: Loud noise alerts all nearby
5: +1 Corruption
6: Lose spell until rest

MAJOR MISCAST (d10):

3-4: +2 Corruption
5-6: Daemon manifestation (fight it)
7-8: All magic in area goes wild
9: Permanent minor mutation
10: Portal opens briefly — something notices you
```

NECROMANCY:
- Shyish corrupted by Dhar

---

# PART V: FAITH & GODS

## Empire Gods

```
SIGMAR:

- Priests: Warrior-priests, Witch Hunters
- Blessings: +1 vs Chaos, hammer proficiency
- Sins: Cowardice, tolerating heresy, disunity

ULRIC:

OTHERS: Taal (nature), Rhya (fertility), Verena (justice), Shallya (mercy), Manann (seas)
```

## Divine Mechanics

```
PRAYER:
Roll CHA + Faith vs DC
Success: Blessing activates
Failure: God is busy / you're unworthy

DIVINE FAVOR = FACTION REPUTATION WITH YOUR GOD
Treat your deity as a faction (tracked in Part VI).
This eliminates separate Divine Favor tracking.

At Reputation 0: Blessings withdrawn; penance quest restores to 1
At Reputation 5-6: Once per session, automatic prayer success
```

---

# PART VI: FACTION RELATIONS

## Reputation System

```
Track standing with major powers.

REPUTATION: ●●●○○○ (3/6)

5-6: Champion — trusted, resources, authority
3-4: Respected — good standing, fair deals
2: Tolerated — watched, limited access
1: Distrusted — hostility, may be attacked
0: Enemy — kill on sight

Each faction tracked separately.
Actions for one faction affect others.
```

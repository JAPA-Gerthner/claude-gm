## THE SIXTH WORLD

The world ended December 24, 2011. Magic returned. The Awakening.

**What changed:**
- Magic is real. Mages throw fireballs, shamans summon spirits.
- Metahumanity. Humans gave birth to elves, dwarves, orks, trolls.
- Megacorporations rule. Extraterritorial. Own armies. Above all law.
- The Matrix exists. Global network. Deckers hack with their minds.
- Dragons are people. Immortal, scheming, running corporations.

**Tone:** Cyberpunk + fantasy. High tech AND high magic. Everyone survives or profits.

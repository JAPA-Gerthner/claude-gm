# BLADES-LITE

For: heists, gang warfare, occult mysteries, urban survival in eternal darkness.

---

## THE SHATTERED ISLES

**The Cataclysm:** 1000 years ago, the sun shattered. Gates of Death broke open. Now ghosts outnumber the living.

**What remains:**
- Eternal night. No sun. Only electroplasm-powered lights.
- Lightning barriers keep ghosts OUT. Cities are islands of life.
- Leviathans swim in the Void Sea. Their blood powers everything.
- The Deathlands beyond the barriers. Ruins. Spirits. Death.

**Tone:** Gothic industrial. Morally grey. Everyone's compromised. Survival through crime.

**The Akorosian Empire:** Doskvol is part of the Empire, ruled by the Immortal Emperor — undying for 800+ years, sustained by arcane means. Imperial Inspectors enforce his will. The City Council governs locally but answers to the Emperor.

### Timeline

| Era | Events |
|-----|--------|
| **Before** | The sun existed. Death was final. Magic was rare. |
| **The Cataclysm** | Sun shattered. Gates broke. Ghosts flooded the world. |
| **The Long Night** | Mass death. Survivors fled to defensible positions. |
| **The Barrier Age** | Lightning barriers invented. Cities formed. Leviathan hunting began. |
| **Now** | Doskvol thrives. Corruption spreads. Barriers weaken. |

---

## DOSKVOL

**Population:** ~100,000 souls (census lies)
**Status:** Industrial powerhouse. Ghost capital. Crime haven.

### Districts

| District | Vibe | Danger | Control |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Brightstone** | Wealth, marble, electric light | Low | Aristocracy |
| **Charhollow** | Working poor, packed tenements | High | Crows |
| **Coalridge** | Factories, smoke, rail station | High | Ironworkers |
| **Crow's Foot** | Gang territory, underworld heart | Extreme | The Crows |
| **The Docks** | Harbor, ships, smuggling | High | Dockers Union |
| **Dunslough** | Swamps, eel farms, isolation | Extreme | None |
| **Nightmarket** | Underground bazaar, occult trade | Variable | Merchants |
| **Silkshore** | Pleasure district, theaters | Moderate | The Cabbies |
| **Six Towers** | Academia, libraries, research | Moderate | Charterhall U. |
| **Whitecrown** | Government, Bluecoats, power | Variable | City Council |

### District Details

**Brightstone:** Hilltop wealth. Marble facades. Radiant parks fed by electroplasm. Heavy Bluecoat presence. Ghosts here are expensive secrets.
*Why go:* Heists, blackmail, selling secrets to rival nobles.

**Charhollow:** Cramped streets. Cooking fires. Black markets. The crematorium works overtime. Gangs control turf. Police raid then take bribes.
*Why go:* Cheap allies, fencing goods, recruiting muscle, hiding.

**Coalridge:** Factory smoke. Burning cinders. The Gaddoc Rail Station. Old mining tunnels go DEEP. Rumors of things down there.
*Why go:* Factory theft, train smuggling, recruiting desperate workers.

**Crow's Foot:** The Crows rule absolutely. Ghost pacts with predecessors. Tunnels connect buildings. Disrespect answers to both sides — living AND dead.
*Why go:* Fencing, gang work, restricted goods, information brokers.

**The Docks:** Salt spray. Rotting wood. Foreign traders. Sailors speak of voices in the water, lights in the depths. Drowning victims don't stay dead.
*Why go:* Smuggling routes, cargo theft, ship passage, foreign contacts.

**Dunslough:** Swamp darkness. Eel farms. Water thick with spirits. Some farmers feed ghosts to the eels — makes them larger, more valuable.
*Why go:* Hiding, off-grid supplies, artifacts from ruins, hunting.

**Nightmarket:** Underground cavern. Electroplasm lanterns. Forbidden goods. Ghost brokers. Transactions sometimes require spiritual payment.
*Why go:* Restricted items, occult goods, information trading, spirit medium services.

**Silkshore:** Theater district. Red lights. Private clubs. Ghost-touched entertainment exists here — spirits pressed into service, channeled through performers.
*Why go:* Information, blackmail material, heists, recruiting allies.

**Six Towers:** Libraries. Laboratories. Experiments with spirits. Some succeeded too well. Some have... escaped.
*Why go:* Stealing research, recruiting scholars, supernatural cleanup jobs.

**Whitecrown:** Government district. Council chambers. Bluecoat HQ. Records archives. Ghost pacts for political advantage. The "laws" are whatever power decides.
*Why go:* Document theft, bribing officials, archive raids, political jobs.

## THE VOID SEA & LEVIATHANS

**The Void Sea:** Black, endless water west of Doskvol. Oil-like. Electroplasm-saturated. Lights flicker in the depths — like stars, if stars watched you.

**Leviathans:** Massive creatures in the deep. Not whale, not demon. Partially in ghost-form. One creature spans a city block.

**Why they matter:**
- Their blood IS electroplasm
- Refined electroplasm powers EVERYTHING (barriers, lights, industry)
- Without harvesting, barriers fail, ghosts flood in, everyone dies

**Harvesting:** Steel-reinforced ships. Electroplasm harpoons. High pay. Higher casualties. Takes 1-3 days per tap. When a leviathan bleeds, things are drawn to it — ghosts, demons, hungry things from the depths.

---

## LIGHTNING BARRIERS & DEATHLANDS

**Lightning Barriers:** Massive walls of crackling electricity encircling Doskvol. Blue-white lightning. Low hum becoming roar. Ghosts CANNOT pass.

**Effects:**
- Hair stands on end near barriers
- Electrical burns on exposed skin
- Spirits sense your approach, warn you back

**Crossings:** Northern, Eastern, Southern Gates. Void Sea Route. All have Bluecoat checkpoints. All have smuggling routes nearby.

**The Deathlands:** Beyond the barriers. Flooded ruins. Spirits EVERYWHERE. Strange vegetation. Mutated wildlife. Electromagnetic storms. The deeper you go, the less the world looks like the one you know.

**The Secret:** The barriers are weakening. Not failing yet. But decay is visible. Refineries work overtime. Some believe 20 years left. Others believe the Council is deliberately letting them weaken.

---

## SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS

### Ghosts

When a person dies, they have THREE DAYS before becoming a ghost. During this window:
- Body must be handled carefully (desecration forces premature ghosting)
- Proper death rites ease transition
- Dying person can make "final arrangements"

If body is destroyed before three days, spirit becomes wild ghost — unstable, dangerous.

**Ghost Types:**

| Type | Age | Behavior | Danger |
|------|-----|----------|--------|
| **Fresh** | 0-1 year | Confused, repeating routines | Low |
| **Settled** | 1-10 years | Purposeful, territorial | Moderate |
| **Ancient** | 10+ years | Reality-bending | High |
| **Bound** | Any | Enslaved to binding | Variable |
| **Wraith** | Corrupted | Rage and hunger | Extreme |
| **Echo** | Residual | Automatic repetition | Low |

### Demons

Ancient things predating humanity. Intelligent alien entities. Powered by electroplasm. Almost impossible to kill — only trap or banish.

**Types:** Demons of Form (humanoid), Element (fire/water/earth), Void (shadows), Knowledge (whispers/possession).

**Dealing with demons:** Binding contracts, summoning rituals, appeasement offerings, magical trapping, banishment.

### Hollows

Reanimated corpses lacking soul. Created through necromancy or forced binding. Follow commands. Don't eat/sleep/age. Used as labor, servants, soldiers.

**The horror:** Some people are trapped in their own corpses — conscious but unable to move or speak.

### Electroplasm

Refined leviathan blood. Glowing iridescent liquid.

**States:** Raw (unstable, attracts spirits), refined vials (standard), electroplasm ink (binding contracts), electroplasm ammunition (lethal to spirits).

**Exposure effects:** Brief contact = burns, sensory disturbance. Ingestion = hallucinations, possession risk. Chronic = can perceive ghosts. Overdose = partial ghost transformation.

### Attunement

Those who practice spectrology can:
- Sense ghost presence
- Communicate with spirits
- Create magical wards
- Bind ghosts to objects
- Channel electroplasmic energy (dangerous)

**Cost:** Extended exposure causes spiritual contamination. Gradual loss of identity. Long-term: transformation into something not-quite-alive.

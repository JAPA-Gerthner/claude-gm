# CUSTOM MECHANIC: BATTLETECH — COMMANDER

Narrative BattleTech. You're a mercenary company commander, not a pilot. Manage people, contracts, resources. Mechs are assets, not character sheets.

---

## GAMEPLAY FOCUS

```
Game of Thrones with mechs, not MechWarrior.

COMBAT — simplified, fast:
- 2-3 rolls, decisions, result
- Minutes of real time
- Mechs = assets, combat = episode

MAIN GAMEPLAY — between battles:
- Which contract to take (and what's hidden in fine print)
- Who to hire, who to trust
- House politics — who to support, who to screw over
- Pilot loyalty — Brick is unhappy, what do you do?
- Intrigue — Liao offers more if you sell out Davion
- Resources — no money, mech broken, contract burning
- Reputation — took dirty work, now Davion doesn't call

Story between battles is the foundation. Combat is the climax.
```

## COMMANDER ATTRIBUTES

```
BASE STATS (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA) NOT USED.
You're a commander, not a grunt. Different gameplay — different stats.

TACTICS: reading battle, planning, adaptation
- Combat decisions (and in cockpit if you went in yourself)
- Enemy assessment
- Maneuvers, ambushes, retreat

LEADERSHIP: morale, loyalty, inspiration
- Keeping people together in shit
- Resolving conflicts
- Pre-battle speeches

DIPLOMACY: contracts, factions, negotiations
- Getting better terms
- Relations with employers
- Great House politics

LOGISTICS: money, repairs, supply
- Stretching budget
- Getting parts
- Extraction under fire

INTELLIGENCE: information, assessment, foresight
- What you know before battle
- Contacts and spies
- Reading hidden contract terms
- LIMIT: Each use per mission costs 500 C-bills (informants)
- Uses margin-based outcomes (Partial = vague hints, Success = clear picture)

LEADERSHIP: Now also adds to pilot skill rolls in combat.
- LEADERSHIP 3+: All pilots +1 to morale saves
- LEADERSHIP 5: Pilots reroll one failed check per battle

Scale: 1-5 (as in base). Starting points: 12 to distribute.
```

### Commander in Cockpit

Commander can personally pilot a mech. In this case:
- TACTICS = piloting and gunnery (combat decisions)
- Commander's mech = their card with condition
- Combat stays abstract, just commander risks personally
- Commander mech death = death/capture risk + morale hit

---

## MERCENARY COMPANY

```
=== COMPANY: [NAME] ===

REPUTATION: ●●●●○○○○○○ (4/10) — also MRB grade
TREASURY: [C-bills amount]
MORALE: ●●●●○ (4/5)

REPUTATION = MRB RATING:
1-2: F (Unrated) — no legit contracts
3-4: D (Marginal) — garrison only
5-6: C (Reliable) — standard contracts, can be bonded
7-8: B (Professional) — premium contracts
9: A (Elite) — houses compete for you
10: A+ (Legendary) — write your own terms

Bonded contracts (Rep 5+): +20% pay, break = Rep -3

ECONOMY (C-BILLS):
Monthly upkeep: 5,000 per mech + dropship cost
Pilot salary (included in upkeep): Green 1K, Regular 2K, Veteran 4K, Elite 8K
Contract pay (typical): 100K-300K depending on danger/duration
Starting treasury: 250,000 C-bills

Example: 4 medium mechs + 4 Regular pilots + Leopard = 20K + 8K + 10K = 38K/month

CONTRACT: [current or "seeking work"]
EMPLOYER: [faction]
BASE: [planet / ship]
```

---

## MECHS (SIMPLIFIED)

---

## PILOTS

```
=== PILOT: [CALLSIGN] ===
Skill: Green / Regular / Veteran / Elite
Loyalty: ●●●○○ (3/5)
Trait: [one feature]
Mech: [assigned or "no mech"]

SKILL:
Green: -1 to all rolls
Regular: no modifiers
Veteran: +1
Elite: +2

LOYALTY (like ally clock):
5/5: Devoted — stays through any shit
3-4: Reliable — normal
2: Doubting — may leave after contract
1: On the edge — looking for other work
0: Left or betrayed

LOYALTY CHECK: After each mission, roll d20 + LEADERSHIP vs DC:
- Morale 5: auto-pass
- Morale 4: DC 8 (Easy)
- Morale 3: DC 12 (Medium)
- Morale 2: DC 16 (Hard)
- Morale 1: DC 20 (Very Hard)

Outcomes by margin:
- Crit.Fail (≤-6): -2 loyalty, pilot considers leaving
- Fail (-5 to -1): -1 loyalty
- Partial (0 to +4): loyalty unchanged, but grumbling
- Success (+5 to +9): loyalty stable
- Crit.Success (+10+): +1 loyalty (inspired)

Personal grievance = additional -1 loyalty regardless of roll.

LOYALTY TRIGGERS:
+1: Victory, bonus pay, saved their life, promotion
-1: Defeat, delayed pay, left behind, commander cowardice
-2: Betrayal, mech destroyed without support, comrade death ignored

TRAITS (examples):
+ Cool-headed: bonus on retreat
+ Aggressor: bonus on attack
+ Technician: self-repairs light damage
+ Survivor: reroll death result (once per campaign, then trait spent)
- Hothead: penalty on control
- Greedy: demands more money
- Trauma: trigger → penalty

PILOT TRAINING:
Green → Regular: 3 successful missions, 10K C-bills
Regular → Veteran: 5 missions + notable victory, 25K C-bills
Veteran → Elite: 10 missions + heroic deed, 50K C-bills
Training between contracts: 1 rank per 2 months downtime (double cost)
```

---

## PILOT RELATIONSHIPS

```
Track only significant bonds. Keep it simple.

TWO TYPES:
BOND — saved each other, shared trauma, loyalty
GRUDGE — blame, rivalry turned sour, hate

EFFECTS:
Bond: +1 when fighting together, will risk for each other
Grudge: -1 together OR refuse to cooperate

DEATH IMPACT:
Bonded pilot dies: Survivor -1 loyalty, may seek revenge
Grudge pilot dies: Closure (+1 loyalty) or guilt (-1 loyalty)

One relationship per pilot max. Let drama emerge naturally.
```

---

## MECH ACQUISITION

```
New mechs are RARE. Not a shopping list.

SOURCES:
SALVAGE — battlefield pickup (contract %)
PURCHASE — black market or faction (if relations 7+)
REWARD — exceptional service to faction
CAPTURE — take from enemy (risky op)
INHERITANCE — dead merc company's assets (debt included)

PRICES (black market, negotiable):
Light: 300K-800K C-bills
Medium: 800K-1.5M C-bills
Heavy: 1.5M-3M C-bills
Assault: 3M-6M C-bills

Note: Salvage is THE way to grow. Purchase = desperation or luxury.

AVAILABILITY ROLL (d20 + DIPLOMACY vs DC):
DC 12: Light mechs available
DC 16: Medium mechs available
DC 20: Heavy mechs available
DC 24: Assault mechs available (rare)
Black market: -4 to DC but risk of defects/stolen

Partial success: mech available but condition 3/5 or +30% price.

FACTION REWARD CONDITIONS:
- Relations 8+
- Completed 3+ contracts for them
- Did something exceptional
- They offer — you don't ask
```

---

## RIVAL COMPANIES

```
Competition is constant. Track ONE rival minimum.

=== RIVAL: [COMPANY NAME] ===
Threat: Low / Medium / High
Grudge: ○○○ (0/3)

RIVAL ACTIONS:
- Outbid contracts (DIPLOMACY contest)
- Poach low-loyalty pilots
- Sabotage (at Grudge 3)
- Temporary alliance (mutual enemy)

GRUDGE CLOCK (3 segments):
+1: You take their contract, kill their people, insult them
At 3/3: Open hostility — ambush, war

REDUCING GRUDGE:
- Give them a contract lead (-1, once per 3 months)
- Joint op against common enemy (-1, requires real threat)
- Bribe/payment (-1, costs 50K + 10K × your Rep grade)
```

---

## DROPSHIP

```
Your mobile base. Lose it = crisis.

=== DROPSHIP: [NAME] ===
Class: Leopard (4 mechs) / Union (12) / Overlord (36)
Status: Operational / Damaged / Crippled

MONTHLY COSTS:
Leopard: 10K | Union: 30K | Overlord: 100K

STATUS:
Operational: Normal
Damaged: -1 to extraction rolls, needs 50K repair
Crippled: Cannot move, emergency only, needs 150K+ repair

DAMAGE TRIGGERS:
Failed extraction, ambush in transit, combat landing gone wrong
GM decides when — rare but dramatic.

NO DROPSHIP = employer controls your movement
```

---

## EMERGENCY MECHANICS

```
When things go wrong. Recovery options.

EMERGENCY LOAN (Rep 3+):
- Borrow up to 50K × Rep grade (Rep 5 = 250K max)
- 10% interest per month (manageable but painful)
- Default = Rep drops 2 grades, creditors seize 1 mech as collateral
- Second loan within 6 months: DIPLOMACY vs DC 16, Partial = half amount

FACTION AID (Relations 7+):
- Request once per campaign from loyal faction
- Costs -2 faction relations
- Receive: 100K C-bills OR loaner mech (must return) OR free repairs

DESPERATION CONTRACT:
- Always available, no negotiation
- Danger +2, pay -30%
- Immediate deployment, no prep time

SELL MECH PARTS:
- Strip any mech for 30% of class value
- Light: 100K, Medium: 250K, Heavy: 500K, Assault: 1M
- Mech destroyed in process
```

---

## DOWNTIME EVENTS

```
Between contracts, things happen. Roll d20 or GM picks.

EVENTS TABLE:
1-2: DISASTER — fire, theft, sabotage. Lose 10K or equipment.
3-4: PILOT TROUBLE — brawl, arrest, addiction. Pay 5K or -1 loyalty.
5-6: RIVAL MOVE — they got the contract you wanted.
7-8: RUMOR — info about lucrative job (may be trap).
9-10: TECH FIND — rare part available (half price, limited time).
11-12: RECRUIT — skilled pilot looking for work (interview).
13-14: FACTION CONTACT — house agent wants to talk (opportunity).
15-16: OLD FRIEND — NPC from past appears (help or complication).
17-18: JOURNALIST — wants your story (+1 rep or scandal risk).
19-20: WINDFALL — unexpected payment, inheritance, or salvage find.

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES (per month):
- Repair mechs (LOGISTICS)
- Train pilots (costs money)
- Seek contracts (DIPLOMACY)
- Gather intel (INTELLIGENCE, costs 500 C-bills)
- R&R: +1 morale, but costs 2K per pilot
- Recruit: find new pilots (availability roll)
```

---

## CONTRACT COMPLICATIONS

```
Hidden terms and surprises. GM rolls secretly or picks.

COMPLICATION TABLE (d20):
1: SETUP — it's a trap, enemy knows you're coming
2: BETRAYAL — employer will abandon/betray you mid-mission
3: WRONG INTEL — enemy force 2× reported strength
4: CIVILIAN PRESENCE — collateral damage = reputation loss
5: TIME PRESSURE — deadline halved, no negotiation
6-7: POLITICAL — secret faction agenda, you're a pawn
8-9: RIVAL — competitor also on contract, race or conflict
10-11: TERRAIN — difficult ground, -1 to mech operations
12-13: SUPPLY — no local resupply, what you bring is all you have
14-15: COMMS — jamming, no reinforcement calls
16-17: WEATHER — storms, heat, cold — environmental penalty
18-19: SECONDARY — hidden objective revealed mid-mission
20: CLEAN — exactly as described (rare)

INTEL MITIGATION:
INTELLIGENCE roll before contract vs DC 16:
- Crit.Fail: False intel (GM lies about complication)
- Fail: No useful intel
- Partial: Learn if complication exists (yes/no)
- Success: Learn complication category
- Crit.Success: Learn exact complication
```

```

---

## COMBAT (ABSTRACT)

```
Don't simulate each shot. Combat = series of decisions.

COMBAT PHASES:

1. INTELLIGENCE (before combat)
   - Roll INTELLIGENCE vs difficulty
   - Success: know the situation, choose approach
   - Fail: surprises, enemy dictates

2. PLAN
   - Choose tactics: attack / defense / maneuver / retreat
   - Assign mechs to roles

   RETREAT RULES:
   Roll TACTICS vs DC 12 (+ enemy strength modifiers)
   - Crit.Fail (≤-6): Rout — 6+ damage, lose slowest mech, Rep -2
   - Fail (-5 to -1): Escape, 4-5 damage, may lose straggler
   - Partial (0 to +4): Escape, 2-3 condition damage
   - Success (+5 to +9): Escape, 1 condition damage (rearguard only)
   - Crit.Success (+10+): Clean escape, no damage
   Contract result: Partial completion (-50% pay, no salvage, Rep -1)

3. CLASH
   - Roll TACTICS + modifiers vs DC

   COMBAT DC:
   Base: 12 (Medium)
   +2: Enemy numerical advantage (per extra mech)
   +2: Enemy skill advantage (higher avg pilot tier)
   +2: Poor terrain for your approach
   +4: Fortified enemy position
   -2: Your numerical advantage (per extra mech)
   -2: Ambush/surprise (you have it)
   -2: Superior intel (INTELLIGENCE success)

   OUTCOMES (margin = result - DC):
   - Crit.Fail (≤-6): Rout — 0% pay, Rep -2, employer furious, heavy losses
   - Fail (-5 to -1): Defeat — 25% pay, Rep -1, losses without result
   - Partial (0 to +4): Pyrrhic — objective achieved with losses, 75% pay
   - Success (+5 to +9): Victory — objective achieved, minimal losses, 100% pay
   - Crit.Success (+10+): Decisive — 100% pay + bonus salvage, Rep +1

4. CASUALTIES
   DAMAGE POOL by result:
   - Success: 1-2 condition total
   - Partial: 3-5 condition total
   - Fail: 4-6 condition total
   - Crit.fail: 6-10 condition + pilot injuries

   CAP: Max 3 damage per mech per battle (prevents instant wipes)

   DISTRIBUTION (simple):
   - Front line: 2 damage each
   - Support/reserve: 1 damage each
   - Scout/flanking: 1 damage (but last to take)
   - Assault: -1 damage (armor)
   - Light on retreat: -1 damage (speed)
   GM distributes pool using these as guide, not exact math.

   PILOT INJURY (when mech hits 0):
   Roll d20:
   Green:   1-4 dead (20%), 5-10 wounded, 11+ safe
   Regular: 1-3 dead (15%), 4-9 wounded, 10+ safe
   Veteran: 1-2 dead (10%), 3-8 wounded, 9+ safe
   Elite:   1 dead (5%), 2-6 wounded, 7+ safe
   Survivor trait: reroll death result (once per campaign, then spent)

MODIFIERS:
+ Numerical superiority
+ Preparation/ambush
+ High pilot skill
+ Good mechs for role
- Numerical disadvantage
- Enemy surprise
- Low morale
- Damaged mechs
```

---

## SALVAGE AND LOOT

```
After battle:
- Destroyed enemies = potential salvage
- Salvage % in contract = what you take (MAX 50%)
- Rest goes to employer
- Higher salvage % = lower cash payment

SALVAGE CAP: Never exceed 50%. Employers won't allow more.
Negotiation improves quality of choices, not percentage beyond cap.

SALVAGE VALUE:
Intact mech: 500K-2M (extremely rare, roll 20)
Damaged mech: 100K-500K (repair at your cost)
Parts: 10K-50K (repair materials)
Weapons: 20K-100K (upgrades or sale)

BUYING SALVAGE:
- Can buy from employer at 150% market value
- DIPLOMACY vs DC 16: Partial = 135%, Success = 120%, Crit = 100%
```

---

## REPAIR AND LOGISTICS

```
REPAIR (costs by mech class — Light/Med/Heavy/Assault):
- Light damage (5→4): 1 day, 2K/5K/10K/15K C-bills
- Medium (4→3, 3→2): 3 days, 5K/15K/30K/50K C-bills

- Fail (-5 to -1): Complications — +50% time OR +50% cost (choose)
- Partial (0 to +4): Repair done but +25% cost or +1 day

## THE SUCCESSION WARS

```
WHY THE FUTURE IS BROKEN:

STAR LEAGUE (2571-2780):
- Humanity united, peak technology
- JumpShips everywhere, factories on every world
- HPG network connected all — instant communication

THE FALL:
- Amaris Coup → Civil War → Cameron line extinct
- Great Houses grab for throne → First Succession War (2786)
- Nuclear hellfire, orbital bombardment, factory targeting
- Four Succession Wars in 250 years

RESULT (by 3025):
- Technology LOST — can't build new, barely repair old
- Factories destroyed — mechs are heirlooms
- Knowledge gaps — "this is how grandfather did it"
- Population crashed — billions dead

WHY MECHS ARE PRECIOUS:
- A Marauder might be 200 years old
- No replacement — lose it, gone forever
- Technicians follow family traditions, not manuals
- "Working" means "doesn't explode today"

LOSTECH — Lost Technology:
- Double Heat Sinks (legendary)
- Gauss Rifles (museum pieces)
- Star League-era anything (worth killing for)
- Finding LosTech = retirement money or faction reward

ERA SELECTION (optional):
3025: Classic — no Clans, Houses fighting, tech scarce
3039: War of 3039 — Davion-Steiner alliance, last big push
3049+: Clan Invasion — everything changes (advanced rules)
Default: 3025 — purest mercenary experience

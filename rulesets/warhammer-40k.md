# PART III: CORRUPTION SYSTEM

Same core as Fantasy, adapted for 40K.

## Corruption Scale

```
CORRUPTION: ●●○○○○○○○○ (2/10)

0: Pure — Emperor's light shields you
1-2: Tainted — Warp whispers, bad dreams
3-4: Marked — Mutations begin, daemons notice
5-6: Corrupted — Visible changes, madness risk
7-8: Damned — Major mutations, possession risk
9: Lost — Daemon Prince potential or Spawn
10: Spawn/Possessed — character ends
```

## Gaining Corruption

```
EXPOSURE:
+1: Warp travel without Gellar field
+1: Using unsanctioned psychic powers
+1: Contact with daemon/warp entity
+1: Reading heretical texts
+1: Chaos ritual (witnessed)
+2: Chaos ritual (participated)
+1: Using Chaos artifact
+1: Breaking sacred oath to Emperor
+2: Accepting Chaos gift/mark

TEMPTATION:
Chaos offers power → accept = power + corruption
Refuse = no corruption, may anger patron

MUTATIONS:
At Corruption 3+: GM rolls mutation table when corruption increases
```

## Reducing Corruption

```
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT in 40K:

-1: Extended penance and prayer (weeks)
-1: Pilgrimage to holy site
-1: Act of extreme faith (martyrdom-level)
-2: Inquisitorial sanctioning (rare, painful)
-1: Mechanicus purity rituals (tech-heresy risk)

CANNOT reduce below mutation count.
Mutations are permanent (usually).

BREAKING THE FLOOR:
- Extreme measures (limb removal, mind-wipe)
- Redemption through death (restart character with +1 honor)

MINOR CLEANSING (easier options):
-1: Destroy daemon or Chaos artifact in combat
-1: Confession to sanctioned priest + 3 days penance
-1: Save innocent life at personal risk
-1: WIS save DC 15 after genuine act of faith in battle

ANTI-DEATH SPIRAL:
- At Corruption 5, may declare "Redemption Arc"
- Cannot gain corruption benefits, but heroic sacrifice = -1 corruption
- Complete major anti-Chaos quest = -2 corruption, reduce mutation floor by 1
- "Emperor's Grace" (1/campaign): Reset to Corruption 3, mutations to 1
  Requires genuine sacrifice of something precious. Cannot be Chaos-marked.
```

## Mutation Table (d20)

```
Roll when corruption increases at 3+:

1-5: Hidden (internal)
     Examples: disturbing dreams, voice in head, unnatural hunger

6-10: Concealable
      Examples: scales under clothes, extra fingers, unnatural eyes

11-15: Visible
       Examples: horns, tentacle, skin color change, extra limb

16-18: Major
       Examples: bestial features, psychic stigmata, warp glow

19-20: "Gift"
       Roll again + gain one: +1 stat OR minor power OR daemon weapon bond
       This is Chaos rewarding you. It always has a price.

MUTATION AGENCY (OPTIONAL):
Player chooses visibility tier; GM determines specific mutation.
```

---

# PART IV: PSYCHIC POWERS

## The Perils of the Warp

```
Psykers channel the Warp. The Warp is Hell. Do the math.

SANCTIONING:
- Imperial psykers are soul-bound to Emperor (Astropaths)

| 4      | Beta       | +4        | Nat 1-2     | Standard       |
| 5      | Beta-plus  | +5        | Nat 1-2     | Major          |
| 6      | Alpha      | +6        | Nat 1-3     | Major          |
| 7+     | Alpha-Plus | +7        | Nat 1-4     | Apocalyptic    |

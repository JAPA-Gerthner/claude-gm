## THE DARK FUTURE

### Timeline

**The Collapse (1994-2000):** Economy crashed. Governments fell. Corps rose.
**Corporate Wars (2000-2023):** Multiple corp conflicts. Fourth Corp War (2021-2023): Arasaka vs Militech. Cities burned.

**Time of the Red (2023-2045):** Red skies from fallout. Net destroyed. Edgerunner era peaks.
**Reunification (2045-2077):** Corps rebuild. Night City rises. Another war brewing.

### World State

- **Governments:** Collapsed. NUSA (New United States) is a shell. Corps rule.
- **Megacorps:** Sovereign entities with private armies. Above all laws.
- **The Net:** Old Net destroyed (DataKrash). New Net is fragmented, Blackwall-protected.
- **Environment:** Acid rain. Smog. Real food is luxury. Synth-protein for masses.

### Night City

**Population:** ~5 million (official), ~8 million (actual)

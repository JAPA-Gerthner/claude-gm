## SETTING OVERVIEW

### THE AWAKENING (1648)
The Treaty of Westphalia ended thirty years of religious slaughter. Mass death created
a wound in reality. Something old woke beneath the oceans.

- Kraken-gods sleeping since before humanity begin to dream
- Atlantean seals crack, boundaries between worlds thin
- Magic strongest near water, weakest inland
- By 1700: supernatural is undeniable worldwide

### THEMES
- Freedom vs. Law (pirate republics vs. colonial powers)
- Greed and its costs (cursed gold, bargains with dark powers)
- The sea as living entity (Davy Jones, ancient spirits, the deep)
- Found family (crew as chosen kin)

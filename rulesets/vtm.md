# CUSTOM MECHANIC: VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE

Night politics, hunger, the beast within. Serious VtM without random Malkavians.

---

## THE DARK MYTHOLOGY

```
=== CAINE — THE FIRST VAMPIRE ===

In the beginning, Caine slew Abel and was cursed by God.
He became the First Vampire — the Dark Father of all Kindred.

THE CURSE: Walk the night forever. Drink only blood.
           Never know death. Never know peace.

THE BOOK OF NOD:
Fragmented scripture of Kindred origins.
Chronicles Caine's exile, his childer, the First City.
Sabbat treats it as holy text. Camarilla dismisses it.
No complete copy exists.

=== THE GENERATIONS ===

2nd Generation: Caine's direct childer (destroyed in Flood)
3rd Generation: THE ANTEDILUVIANS — 13 founders of the clans
                Each shaped a clan in their image.
                Most sleep in torpor. Some say they'll wake.
                When they do: GEHENNA.

=== GEHENNA — THE END TIMES ===

The Antediluvians will rise.
They will consume their childer, generation by generation.
The blood returns to its source. This is Gehenna.

Signs (many have occurred):
- Thin-bloods walk among us (14th-15th generation)
- The Ravnos Antediluvian woke and died (1999)
- Elders feel "called" eastward (The Beckoning)

=== THE JYHAD ===

The eternal war of Methuselahs.
Elders manipulate younger Kindred like chess pieces.
Every conflict serves someone's hidden agenda.
Nothing is coincidence. Everyone is a pawn.

## VAMPIRE ATTRIBUTES

```
Instead of standard stats:

PHYSICAL (STR+DEX+CON averaged):
- Combat, chase, endurance
- Vampires are inherently stronger than humans

SOCIAL (CHA):
- Manipulation, persuasion, lies
- Key for Camarilla politics

MENTAL (INT+WIS):
- Investigation, occultism, tactics
- Resisting mental disciplines

BLOOD:
- Generation determines maximum
- Spent on disciplines, healing, enhancement
```

---

## HUNGER

```
HUNGER: ○○○○○ (0-5)

0: Sated — full control
1-2: Normal — mild discomfort
3: Hungry — distracting, -1 to MENTAL
4: Very hungry — beast is close, -2 to all social
5: On the edge — any stress = Frenzy risk

HUNGER RISES:
+1: Every night (baseline)
+1: Using discipline
+1: Healing wounds (1 damage = 1 hunger)
+1: Physical enhancement (super strength, speed)

HUNGER DROPS:
-1 to -3: Feeding (depends on victim)
```

---

## FEEDING

```
BLOOD SOURCES:

Animals:
- Available, safe for Masquerade
- Only -1 hunger, never to 0
- Some clans disdain it (status)

Blood bags:
- Need to obtain (hospitals, contacts)
- -1 hunger, dead blood — doesn't fully satisfy

Mortals (not killing):
- -2 hunger
- Masquerade risk if not careful
- SOCIAL roll so victim doesn't remember

Mortals (to death):
- Full hunger reset to 0
- HUMANITY -1
- Must hide corpse (Masquerade)

Another vampire:
- -3 hunger, but DIABLERIE if to death
- Diablerie = soul absorption, power + curse

RESONANCE (optional):
Victim's emotions affect blood:
- Fear: bonus to Physical
- Desire: bonus to Social
- Anger: bonus to combat disciplines
- Melancholy: bonus to Mental
```

---

## HUMANITY

```
HUMANITY: ●●●●●●●○○○ (7/10 start)

10: Saint — almost human, sun barely harms
8-9: Humane — normal emotions, guilt
6-7: Normal vampire — balance of human and beast
4-5: Detached — dulled emotions, humans = food
2-3: Monster — barely controls beast
1: On the edge — one bad decision from the end
0: Wight — NPC, lost forever

HUMANITY LOSS:

Transgression severity → MENTAL roll vs DC

DC 8 (minor): Killing in self-defense, feeding with minor harm
DC 12 (moderate): Killing a mortal, torture, betraying ally
DC 16 (severe): Killing innocent for pleasure, diablerie, mass murder
DC 20 (monstrous): Killing a child, genocide, atrocities

Margin-based outcomes:
Crit.Fail (≤-6): Beast Ascendant — Humanity -2, immediate Frenzy check
Fail (-5 to -1): Stain — Humanity -1
Partial (0 to +4): Haunted — no Humanity loss, but -1 to next control check
Success (+5 to +9): Justified — no Humanity loss, conscience intact
Crit.Success (+10+): Transcended — no loss, +1 Humanity possible (GM decides)

RESTORATION:
- Redemption (difficult, requires roleplay)
- Protecting innocents
- Self-sacrifice
- +1 maximum per arc if GM approves
```

---

## THE BEAST / FRENZY

```
FRENZY TRIGGERS:

RAGE (attack source):
- Provocation, insult
- Fire nearby (fear → aggression)
- Life threat

HUNGER (attack nearest blood):
- Hunger 4+ and blood nearby
- Wounded when hungry
- Fresh blood smell

TERROR (flee):
- Fire
- Sunlight
- True Faith

CONTROL CHECK:
d20 + MENTAL - Hunger vs DC (depends on trigger)

Margin-based outcomes:
Crit.Fail (≤-6): Lost to the Beast — Frenzy d6 turns, Humanity check after
Fail (-5 to -1): Frenzy — d4 turns, no Humanity check
Partial (0 to +4): Riding the Wave — 1 turn of Beast action, then control
Success (+5 to +9): Mastered — Beast contained, shaken but in control
Crit.Success (+10+): Iron Will — Beast silenced, +2 to next control check tonight

DURING FRENZY:
- No control — GM describes actions
- Beast pursues goal (kill/feed/flee)
- Ignores pain, allies, Masquerade
- Ends when trigger removed

MODIFIER: low Humanity = harder to control
Humanity 4-: disadvantage on control check

"Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood."
- Never show vampirism to mortals
- Includes: fangs, disciplines, feeding
- Punishment: Final Death
- Digital traces count (cameras, social media)

=== SECOND: THE DOMAIN ===
"Thy domain is thine own concern. All others owe thee respect."
- Prince's domain = entire city

- Trespassing without permission = offense

=== THIRD: THE PROGENY ===
"Thou shall only Sire with permission of thine Elder."

- Unreleased childer have NO standing

=== FIFTH: HOSPITALITY ===
"When thou comest to a foreign city, present thyself to the ruler."
- Entering city = must present to Prince (within 3 nights)
- Until presented, you have NO rights
- Prince may refuse entry entirely

=== SIXTH: DESTRUCTION ===
"Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind."

```

BLOOD BONDS:

- Hard to resist commands
- 1 year without blood = weakens

DIABLERIE:

- Lowers generation by 1
- Gains victim's power
- Visible in aura (black veins)
- Camarilla executes for this
```

---

## BLOOD POTENCY

```
Blood Potency: power of the blood (tied to Generation).

| Generation | Blood Potency | Discipline Max | Feeding Restriction |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 14th-15th  | 0 (Thin)      | 1              | None (can eat food) |
| 13th       | 1             | 2              | None                |
| 12th       | 1-2           | 3              | None                |
| 11th       | 2-3           | 4              | None                |

- Boost Attribute for 1 turn

BANE SEVERITY:

## INTEGRATION WITH BASE SYSTEM

```
ROLLS:
d20 + stat vs DC (margin-based from gm-skill.md)
≤-6 Crit.Fail | -5..-1 Fail | 0..+4 Partial | +5..+9 Success | +10+ Crit
Disciplines usually auto-success or stat vs resistance

COMBAT:
Vampires regenerate (Hunger +1 per heal)
Aggravated damage (fire, sun, claws) — doesn't heal easily

SOCIAL:
Disciplines give advantage or auto-success
But Dominate doesn't work on vampires of older generation

CLOCKS:
- City factions (Camarilla, Anarchs, Sabbat)
- Masquerade
- Hunger as passive tick

ALLIES:
- Ghouls (mortals on blood) — servants
- Vampire allies — politics, debts
- Mortal contacts — Masquerade, daytime affairs
```

3. What do they represent? (innocence, love, honor)
4. Where do they live? (potential threat/story)

=== BENEFITS ===

VISIT (unharmed): -1 to Frenzy DC next session
PROTECT from harm: +1 Humanity possible (GM decides)

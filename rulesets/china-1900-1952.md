# CHINA 1900-1952 — Warlords, Revolution, Survival

Complete setting: Boxer Rebellion → Warlord Era → Japanese Invasion → Civil War.

**For:** Soldiers, spies, refugees, revolutionaries. All sides grey, no propaganda.

---

## SETTING OVERVIEW

**Period:** 1900-1952 (52 years of continuous conflict)
**Themes:** Survival, loyalty tested, ideology vs pragmatism, family divided
**Tone:** Grim but not hopeless. Personal stories over grand narratives.

### The Core Conflict
```
China torn apart by:
- Foreign powers carving concessions
- Warlords fighting for scraps
- Revolutionaries with competing visions
- Japan's invasion and occupation
- Civil war between KMT and CCP

NO GOOD GUYS. Every faction has heroes and monsters.
Every choice has cost. Survival is victory.
```

### Handling Atrocities (HOI4 Approach)
```
SHOW: Aftermath, survivor reactions, empty villages, refugees
      NPCs who "don't speak of what happened"
      Documents listing "those taken"

DON'T: Detail specific acts, use as shock content, minimize
       Perpetrator descriptions, graphic violence

Example: "The village is too quiet. Signs of hasty departure
         mixed with signs it wasn't voluntary. The guide
         falls to his knees. 'My cousin's village,' he whispers."
```

# PART II: FACTIONS

## Qing Dynasty (until 1912)

```
STRUCTURE: Emperor → Grand Council → Eight Banners → Provinces

KEY FIGURES:
- Empress Dowager Cixi: Ruled 47 years, master survivor
- Guangxu Emperor: Reform-minded, imprisoned after 1898 coup
- Puyi: Last emperor, age 2 when enthroned, later Japanese puppet

WHY IT FELL:
- Taiping Rebellion (20-30 million dead)
- Lost wars to Britain, France, Japan
- Boxer disaster (1900)
- Reforms too late

AFTER 1912:
- Puyi kept in Forbidden City until 1924
- Restoration attempt 1917 (12 days)
- Some joined Japanese collaboration
```

## Beiyang Warlords (1912-1928)

Yuan Shikai's army splits into cliques after his death (1916).

### Zhili Clique (Hebei Region)

```
CONTROLLED: Beijing government 1920-1924
ORIENTATION: "Pro-Western" (relatively)
BASE: Zhili province (modern Hebei), Luoyang

WU PEIFU "Jade Marshal" (1874-1939):
- Scholar-general, incorruptible, genuinely popular
- TIME Magazine cover 1924: "Strongest man in China"
- Brilliant tactician, terrible politician
- FATE: Refused Japanese collaboration even when they controlled his territory
        Died after refusing treatment from Japanese dentist
        "I would rather die than serve the enemy"

CAO KUN (1862-1938):
- Corrupt but loyal to Zhili cause
- BRIBERY ELECTION (1923): Paid MPs 5,000-10,000 yuan each
  Won presidency through "pig-pen parliament"
  International embarrassment, undermined Republic
- FATE: Overthrown 1924, refused Japanese collaboration, died in poverty

WHY THEY MATTER:
- Closest thing to "good guys" among warlords (low bar)
- Wu Peifu = tragic hero archetype
- Their fall = Beijing Coup = everything changes
```

### Fengtian Clique (Manchuria)

```
CONTROLLED: Three northeastern provinces (Manchuria)
ORIENTATION: Complex relationship with Japan
BASE: Mukden (Shenyang)

ZHANG ZUOLIN "Old Marshal" (1875-1928):
- Bandit → Qing officer → warlord → national leader
- Rose during Boxer chaos, "pacified" by Qing 1902
- Shrewd, ruthless, respected even by enemies
- JAPAN RELATIONSHIP:
  + Accepted Japanese support early
  + Manchuria had Japanese railway interests
  - Refused to become puppet
  - Played Japan against other powers
- FATE: Assassinated by Japanese (Huanggutun Incident, June 1928)
        Kwantung Army blew up his train
        Japan frustrated he wouldn't submit

ZHANG XUELIANG "Young Marshal" (1901-2001):
- Inherited Manchuria at 27, playboy reformed into patriot
- 1928: "Northeastern Flag Replacement" — joined Nationalists
- 1931: Lost Manchuria (ordered by Chiang: don't resist)
        Became opium addict, then recovered
- 1936: XI'AN INCIDENT
        His troops wanted to fight Japan, not Communists
        Kidnapped Chiang to force united front
        Chiang agreed, Zhang surrendered himself
        Expected execution, got house arrest instead
- FATE: 54 YEARS house arrest (1936-1990)
        Released, moved to Hawaii, died at 100
        Gave up everything for national unity. Worth it?

WHY THEY MATTER:
- Zhang Zuolin = self-made warlord, died rather than submit
- Zhang Xueliang = tragic patriot, lost everything
- Manchuria's loss = national trauma, road to full war
```

### Anhui Clique

```
CONTROLLED: Beijing government 1916-1920
ORIENTATION: Pro-Japanese (took Nishihara Loans)
BASE: Anhui province

DUAN QIRUI (1865-1936):
- Competent administrator, poor judge of character
- "War participation army" scheme to get WWI weapons
- Nishihara Loans: mortgaged sovereignty for cash
- March 18 Massacre (1926): troops fired on protesters
- FATE: Lost power 1920, retired
        Refused Japanese collaboration during occupation
        Died in poverty, reputation partially restored

WHY THEY MATTER:
- First to fall (Zhili-Anhui War 1920)
- Japanese loans = template for later collaboration
- Shows how "pro-Japan" wasn't simple treason
```

### The Clique Wars

```
ZHILI-ANHUI WAR (July 1920):
- Cause: Control of Beijing
- Forces: Zhili + Fengtian vs. Anhui
- Result: Anhui crushed in 5 days
- Consequence: Duan retires, Zhili-Fengtian alliance

FIRST ZHILI-FENGTIAN WAR (April-May 1922):
- Cause: Former allies fight over Beijing
- Key battle: Wu Peifu defeats Zhang Zuolin
- Result: Zhang retreats to Manchuria
- Consequence: Wu Peifu at peak power

SECOND ZHILI-FENGTIAN WAR (Sept-Oct 1924):
- Cause: Zhang Zuolin's revenge
- THE BETRAYAL: Feng Yuxiang turns on Zhili at crucial moment
  His troops were supposed to flank Fengtian
  Instead: Beijing Coup, imprisoned President Cao Kun
- Result: Zhili collapses, Wu Peifu flees south
- Consequence: Nobody really wins, chaos continues

ANTI-FENGTIAN WAR (1925-1926):
- Cause: Everyone fears Zhang Zuolin
- Result: Inconclusive
- Ended by: Northern Expedition changes everything
```

## Regional Warlords

### Yan Xishan — The Model Governor

```
DOMAIN: Shanxi Province (1912-1949) — 37 YEARS
CHARACTER: Pragmatic survivalist, genuine administrator

HOW HE SURVIVED EVERYONE:
1912 — Supported Republic (when Qing fell)
1917 — Ignored restoration attempt
1927 — Joined Nationalists (when they won)
1930 — Rebelled against Chiang, lost, forgiven
1937 — Fought Japan (sometimes negotiated)
1945 — Fought Communists
1949 — Fled to Taiwan

WHAT HE BUILT:
+ Railways, roads, arsenals
+ Universal education program
+ Banned foot-binding, opium
+ "Village system" local governance
+ Relatively low corruption
+ His people generally better off than neighbors

"YAN XISHAN THOUGHT":
- Mix of Confucianism, militarism, socialism
- "Shanxi for the Shanxi people"
- Neither capitalist nor communist
- Local industry, self-sufficiency

THE CATCH:
- Isolated Shanxi from China's problems (and solutions)
- Authoritarian control
- Some negotiation with Japanese (debated: collaboration or survival?)

FOR PLAYERS: Best example of "warlordism that worked"
             Stability through pragmatism
             "Survive by being useful to whoever's winning"
```

### Feng Yuxiang — The Christian General

```
DOMAIN: Various (never stable territory)
CHARACTER: Theatrical, unpredictable, possibly sincere

FAMOUS FOR:
- Baptized troops with fire hoses
- Wore peasant clothes, lived simply
- Soldiers sang hymns, learned to read
- Changed sides MORE THAN ANYONE

THE BETRAYALS:
1924 — Betrayed Zhili Clique (Beijing Coup)
1926 — Joined Nationalists
1927 — Switched sides during purge debates
1929 — Rebelled against Chiang
1930 — Rebelled AGAIN (Central Plains War)
1930s — Opposition figure, never power again

WAS HE SINCERE?
PRO-SINCERITY:              PRO-OPPORTUNIST:
- Lived simply              - Changed sides constantly
- Troops well-treated       - Allied with anyone useful
- Land reform attempts      - Christianity possibly theatrical
- Consistent anti-Japan     - Never kept agreements

FATE: Died 1948 in ship fire en route to Soviet conference
      Suspicious circumstances, never solved
      Was he assassinated? By whom? Never proven.

FOR PLAYERS: "Which Feng is real?" scenarios
             His troops were loyal. Everyone else confused.
             Perfect patron for unpredictable campaigns
```

### Guangxi Clique — The Professionals

```
DOMAIN: Guangxi Province, South China
CHARACTER: Professional, capable, proud — "Little Guangxi can swallow big China"

LI ZONGREN (1891-1969):
- Rose from poverty on merit, united Guangxi with Bai Chongxi
- TAIERZHUANG (1938): First major victory vs Japan
  20,000+ Japanese casualties, proved "we CAN win"
- 1949: Acting President when Chiang "retired"
  Tried to negotiate with CCP, had no real power
  "President of nothing"
- FATE: US exile → returned to PRC 1965 → died Beijing

BAI CHONGXI (1893-1966) "Little Zhuge":
- Never lost battle he personally commanded
- Japanese avoided his sectors
- Devout Muslim, strict discipline
- Knew he was smarter than Chiang, didn't hide it
- FATE: Taiwan, marginalized, died 1966

THE GUANGXI SYSTEM:
+ Professional training, German advisors
+ Militia system (every village armed)
+ Soldiers could read (rare!)
+ Zhuang minority integration
- Harsh conscription, brutal discipline
- "We're better than you" friction with Chiang

THEIR WARS WITH CHIANG:
1929 — Rebelled (lost)
1930 — Rebelled again (almost won)
1949 — Blamed him for losing China

FOR PLAYERS: Competent men in incompetent system
             What happens when skill isn't enough?
```

### Ma Clique — Lords of the Northwest

```
DOMAIN: Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu (Northwest China)
CHARACTER: Muslim warlords, fiercely independent, cavalry masters

THE "FIVE MA":
- Ma Qi (Qinghai, early)
- Ma Lin (Qinghai, succeeded Ma Qi)
- Ma Bufang (Qinghai, most famous)
- Ma Hongkui (Ningxia)
- Ma Hongbin (Gansu)

MA BUFANG (1903-1975) — Most Powerful:
ACHIEVEMENTS:           ATROCITIES:
+ Built schools         - Brutal suppression of Tibetans
+ Modern army          - Forced labor
+ Infrastructure       - Ethnic persecution
+ Fought CCP well      - Harsh conscription

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Hui Muslim identity central to everything
- Cavalry-focused armies (horses > tanks in mountains)
- Control of Silk Road trade routes
- Deeply anti-Communist (Long March battles)
- Nominally Nationalist, practically independent

RELATIONS:
- Nationalists: "Yes sir" (does whatever he wants)
- Communists: BITTER ENEMIES
  Long March passed through their territory
  Ma cavalry harassed retreating Red Army
- Japanese: No collaboration (too remote to matter)
- Tibetans: Territorial conflict, raids, tension
- Soviets: Hostile (Xinjiang rivalry)

FATE (1949):
- Ma Bufang: Fled to Egypt, then Saudi Arabia (died 1975)
- Ma Hongkui: Fled to Los Angeles (died 1970)
- Others: Killed or captured

FOR PLAYERS: Remote, exotic setting
             Islamic culture meets Chinese politics
             Cavalry warfare in mountains and deserts
             "The CCP will never reach us here" (they did)
```

### Sichuan Warlords — The Forgotten Front

```
DOMAIN: Sichuan Province (Southwest China)
CHARACTER: Constantly fighting each other, then hosted wartime capital

WHY THEY MATTER:
- Sichuan = most populous province
- Constant internal wars (1920s-1930s)
- Then: Chongqing becomes wartime capital (1938-1945)
- Suddenly, center of Free China

LIU XIANG vs LIU WENHUI (uncle vs nephew):
- Same family, fought each other for years
- Liu Xiang won, controlled most of Sichuan
- Died 1938, province absorbed into Nationalist structure

SICHUAN REALITY:
- Opium economy (major producer)
- Warlord armies = opium protection
- "Sichuan people fight Sichuan wars"
- Isolated by geography (mountains everywhere)

FOR PLAYERS: Internal Sichuan campaigns
             Opium trade stories
             "Backwater becomes capital" transition
```

## Kuomintang (KMT)

```
FOUNDED: 1912 by Sun Yat-sen
IDEOLOGY: Three Principles — Nationalism, Democracy, Livelihood
REALITY: One-party dictatorship, never implemented democracy

PHASES:

1. SUN YAT-SEN ERA (to 1925)
   Revolutionary dreams, Soviet alliance
   United Front with CCP
   Whampoa Academy trains both sides

2. KMT LEFT (Wang Jingwei, 1925-1927)
   Socialist-leaning, Wuhan government
   Collapsed after Shanghai Massacre
   No independent military power

3. KMT RIGHT / NANJING (Chiang, 1927-1937)
   Shanghai Massacre — Green Gang muscle
   "Nanjing Decade" — some modernization
   No land reform, no democracy
   White Terror: ~300,000 killed
   Blue Shirts (fascist), Dai Li (spymaster)

4. WANG JINGWEI REGIME (1940-1945)
   Collaboration with Japan
   "Peace Movement" — China's Vichy
   汉奸 (hanjian) = traitor, worst insult

5. CIVIL WAR COLLAPSE (1945-1949)
   Corruption everywhere
   Hyperinflation destroyed middle class
   Armies defected with American weapons
   Manchuria, Huaihai — complete defeats
   Fled to Taiwan with treasures

KEY FIGURES:
- Sun Yat-sen: Visionary, poor judge of character
- Chiang Kai-shek: Survivor, micromanager, lost China
- Wang Jingwei: Revolutionary turned collaborator
- Soong Mei-ling: Charmed Americans, family enriched

```

## Chinese Communist Party (CCP)

   "Peasants are revolutionary sea"
   Jiangxi Soviet (1931-1934)
   Long March survivor, emerged as leader
   Yan'an base (1935-1947)

4. LONG MARCH (1934-1935)
   First Front Army: 86,000 start, ~8,000 finish
   6,000 miles through hostile territory
   Zunyi Conference: Mao takes control
   Zhang Guotao's split, destruction
   Created legend, hardened survivors

5. WAR AND VICTORY
   Second United Front (1937-1945)
   Guerrilla warfare behind Japanese lines
   Land reform won peasant support
   Rectification Campaign (purges)
   Won civil war through mobilization

WHY THEY WON:
- Land reform (KMT never did)
- Peasant support (90% of China)
- Better morale, worse equipment
- KMT corruption drove people to CCP

KEY FIGURES:
- Mao Zedong: Peasant strategy, won, then disasters
- Zhou Enlai: Diplomat, survived all purges
- Zhu De: "Father of Red Army"

   Backed warlords, played factions

2. MANCHUKUO (1932-1945)
   Mukden Incident (staged)
   Puyi puppet emperor
   Three provinces lost
   Collaboration: necessity or treason?

3. SINO-JAPANESE WAR (1937-1945)
   Major cities fell rapidly
   Nanjing (show through aftermath, survivors)
   "Three Alls" in guerrilla areas
   Wang Jingwei collaboration regime

CHINESE RESPONSES:
- KMT: Trade space for time, Chongqing
- CCP: Guerrilla warfare, rural bases
- Collaboration: Some had no choice
- Resistance: Assassins, intelligence, sabotage

HANDLING IN GAME:
Show Chinese agency: resistance, survival, choices
Don't detail Japanese perpetrator actions
Focus on aftermath and survivor perspectives
```

## The Great Inflation (1945-1949)

Why the KMT lost: money became worthless.

```
THE NUMBERS:
1937: 3.4 yuan = $1
1945: 1,200 yuan = $1
1948: 12,000,000 yuan = $1

1948: Prices doubled EVERY FEW HOURS
Gold Yuan reform (Aug 1948): Worthless within 10 months

DAILY LIFE:
- Paid in morning, prices doubled by evening
- Wheelbarrows of cash for bag of rice
- Professor's salary: could buy 4 eggs
- Burning money cheaper than buying firewood
- Workers demanded payment in rice, not cash

WHO SURVIVED:
- Peasants (traded in grain)
- Gold/silver hoarders, black marketeers
- Those with US dollars
- Corrupt officials (stole in USD, paid debts in fabi)

WHO DIED:
- Middle class (savings = toilet paper)
- Fixed-income: teachers, clerks, soldiers
- Anyone who trusted the government

POLITICAL COST:
Middle class = KMT base. Middle class destroyed = KMT collapsed.
CCP promised stability. Anything better than THIS.

SHANGHAI GOLD CRISIS (Aug 1948):
- Chiang sent son Ching-kuo to enforce new currency
- Arrested hoarders, executions
- Worked briefly... then leaked:
  Soong family (Chiang's in-laws) kept THEIR gold
- "One law for us, another for them"
- Credibility destroyed. Even loyalists gave up.
```

### Currencies for Campaigns

```
WORTHLESS PAPER: Fabi (法币), Gold yuan (金圆券)
REAL MONEY: US dollars, gold, silver, grain
BARTER: Rice, cloth, cigarettes, medicine, fuel

Savings destroyed = Survival clock +2
"Join the Communists, they pay in grain"
```

## Minor Factions

```
SECRET SOCIETIES:
- Green Gang (Du Yuesheng): Shanghai underworld
- Provided muscle for Shanghai Massacre
- Opium, gambling, political influence

FOREIGN PRESENCE:
- Treaty ports: Shanghai, Tianjin, etc.
- Flying Tigers, Soviet volunteers
- Missionaries, journalists, adventurers

INTELLECTUALS:
- May Fourth Movement (1919)
- Lu Xun: Greatest modern writer
- Student activism throughout period

ORDINARY PEOPLE:
- Peasants (90%): Whoever taxes less
- Refugees: Every war created millions
- Merchants: Navigate all factions
- Women: Foot-binding ended, new roles
```

# PART IV: CAMPAIGN FRAMEWORKS

## Campaign Types

```
SOLDIER'S STORY:
- Warlord conscript, NRA private, Red Army survivor
- Which uniform today? Same peasant underneath.

OFFICER:
- Whampoa graduate, warlord lieutenant, guerrilla commander
- Brothers at academy, enemies in field

SPY:

```

## Era Campaigns

```
BOXER REBELLION: Spirit possession or desperate resistance?
WARLORD ERA: Allegiances shift monthly, survive the chaos
NORTHERN EXPEDITION: United front that won't stay united
LONG MARCH: 6,000 miles of survival, not victory
ANTI-JAPANESE: Resist the invader, save strength for next war
CIVIL WAR FINALE: Pick the winning side, or disappear
```

## Story Hooks

```
- Your Whampoa classmate is marked for the purge
- Brother in NRA, sister joined Communists
- Collaborate to save family, or resist and watch them burn
- Informing saves your family, dooms your friends
- Former enemy offers defection: trust or trap?
```

## Tone Guidance

```
ALL SIDES GREY: Every faction has heroes and monsters
PERSONAL OVER POLITICAL: One soldier's choice matters more than grand strategy
WAR WEARINESS: 50 years breaks everyone
HOPE IS PRECIOUS: Because it's so rare

"In this game, victory is surviving with your soul mostly intact."

# SENGOKU — Warring States Japan

Complete setting pack for feudal Japan campaigns: honor as social capital, tactical stance dueling, samurai politics.

**For:** Samurai drama, ronin wanderers, ninja intrigue, clan warfare.

---

## SETTING OVERVIEW

**Era:** Sengoku (Warring States) or Edo period
**Themes:** Honor vs survival, duty vs desire, tradition vs change
**Tone:** Can range from heroic bushido to gritty ronin noir

### Social Order
```
Emperor (figurehead)
  └─ Shogun (military ruler)
       └─ Daimyo (clan lords)
            └─ Samurai (warrior class, includes masterless ronin)
                 └─ Commoners (peasants, artisans, merchants)
                      └─ Eta/Burakumin (outcastes)
```

Ninja and outlaw bands (akuto, nobushi) operate outside official hierarchy.
Note: Sengoku was fluid — peasants could rise to samurai (Hideyoshi), merchants wielded real power.

# PART I: HONOR SYSTEM

Social capital for samurai society. Not morality — reputation and status.

## HONOR SCALE

```
HONOR: ●●●●●○○○○○ (5/10)

10 — Legend. Word is law, songs sung about you.
7-9 — Respected. Doors open, word carries weight.
4-6 — Common. Neutral treatment.
1-3 — Questionable. Distrust, whispers.
0 — Dishonorable. Outcast, enemy of society.
```

---

## HONOR EFFECTS

### High Honor (7+)
```
+ CHA +2 with samurai, daimyo, officials (CAP: +4 total from all sources)
+ Samurai allies: +1 to loyalty clock at start
+ Right of challenge: can demand duel, refusal = shame
+ Sanctuary: temples and castles accept you
+ Word accepted without proof
```

### Low Honor (1-3)
```
- CHA -2 with samurai and officials
- Samurai allies: disadvantage on loyalty rolls
- No access to official positions
- May be refused service (tea houses, weaponsmiths)
+ CHA +2 with ronin, criminal gangs, ninja, merchants (CAP: +4 total)
+ "Dirty" tactics without mechanical penalties
```

### Dishonor (0)
```
- Samurai attack or ignore you
- Bounty possible
- Samurai allies leave automatically
+ Complete freedom of action
+ Shadow factions accept as one of their own
```

---

## LOSING HONOR

### Dishonorable Actions

| Action | Loss |
|--------|------|
| Poison | -2 |
| Backstab/ambush on equal | -1 |
| Breaking given word | -2 |
| Killing surrendered | -1 |
| Killing unarmed | -1 |
| Fleeing battlefield | -1 |
| Betraying lord | -3 |
| Torture | -1 |

Note: Trading with foreigners is NOT dishonorable in Sengoku period.
That restriction is Edo-period (Sakoku) policy, not warring states ethics.

### Context Modifiers
```
Against lower status: penalty ×0.5 (round down)
Against equal: full penalty
Against higher status: penalty ×1.5 (round up)
Unseen: penalty ×0.5, but GM rolls d20 — on 15+ rumor spreads
At war: ambushes — no penalty (see Firearms section for guns)

STACKING LIMIT: Modifiers stack once maximum.
Example: "Unseen" + "lower status" = ×0.5 (NOT ×0.25)
Pick the most favorable single modifier only.
```

---

## RESTORING HONOR

| Action | Gain | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Victory in fair duel | +1 | +2 if opponent higher honor |
| Fulfilling duty with risk | +1 | +2 if witnessed publicly |
| Protecting weak/innocent | +1 | +2 if against superior force |
| Revenge for lord/family | +2 | Cap: cannot exceed pre-wrong honor |
| Seppuku | +5 posthumous | Family honor only, not transferable |
| Public penance | +1 | Once per specific transgression |
| Great deed | +2 | GM discretion, songs-worthy |
| Service to new lord | +1 | Per significant mission, max 2/arc |

**Recovery Cap:** Max +3 honor per adventure arc (great deeds can exceed with GM approval).

| Ninja | 2 |
| Merchant | 3 |
| Peasant-warrior | 5 |
| Monk | 6 |

| Foreigner | 0 (outside system) |

### "Outside the System"
Some characters exist outside honor:
- Foreigners (until they adopt culture)
- Ninja under cover
- Eta/burakumin (untouchables)

Effect: No honor bonuses/penalties. Samurai view as tools. Can enter system through service to a lord.

---

## FACTIONS AND HONOR

| Faction | Honor Requirement | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Samurai clans | 4+ | Quests give +1 honor |
| Ronin bands | None | Neutral to honor |

| Merchants | Money > honor | But honor 7+ gets credit |
| Peasants | — | Respect high, fear low |

# PART II: STANCE COMBAT

Tactical dueling system for significant one-on-one fights.

## WHEN TO USE

```
FULL STANCE SYSTEM:
- Boss fights
- Significant duels
- Named enemy samurai
- When player wants tactical depth

BASE COMBAT RULES:
- Random skirmishes
- Multiple enemies
- When pace matters more
```

---

## THE FIVE STANCES

```
         Attack  Defense  Visibility  Zone        Strong vs
JODAN:    +2     -2       DC 10       head        Waki
CHUDAN:   +0     +0       DC 10       head/torso  Jodan
GEDAN:    +0     +2       DC 12       torso/legs  Chudan
HASSO:    -2     +2       DC 14       any         Gedan
WAKI:     +0     +0       DC 16       any         Hasso
```

**Counter cycle:** Chudan→Jodan→Waki→Hasso→Gedan→Chudan (each beats the next)

### Stance Character
- **JODAN** — Aggression. Sword overhead. Deadly but telegraphed (DC 10).
- **CHUDAN** — Balance. Sword forward. Predictable (DC 10) but no penalties.
- **GEDAN** — Defense. Sword low. Harder to read (DC 12), strong counter.
- **HASSO** — Full defense. Sword vertical. Patient, defensive (DC 14).
- **WAKI** — Hidden. Sword behind back. Very hard to read (DC 16), safe (+0/+0).

---

## DUEL ROUND

### Phase 1: Reading the Enemy
```
Roll: WIS vs enemy stance Visibility DC

Success → know enemy's stance, choose consciously
Fail → choose blind (GM doesn't reveal)
```

### Phase 2: Choosing Stance
```
FREE transitions (once per turn):
Jodan ↔ Chudan ↔ Gedan (vertical line)
Hasso ↔ Chudan (through center)

COSTLY transitions (costs bonus action):
Jodan ↔ Gedan (extremes)
Waki ↔ any (from hidden)
```

### Phase 3: Clash
```
Counter bonus:
- Strong vs weak stance = advantage
- Weak vs strong = disadvantage
- Neutral = normal roll

Attack: d20 + STR/DEX + stance mod vs AC + stance mod
Damage: weapon + stance bonus
```

### Phase 4: Zone Wounds
```
STANCE DUELS ONLY — in base combat, use HP only.

Strike zone by attacker's stance:
HEAD (Jodan, Chudan): 1 wound = -2 reading stances | 2 wounds = stunned 1 rd
TORSO (Chudan, Gedan): 1 wound = -2 damage rolls | 2 wounds = bleeding d4/turn
LEGS (Gedan): 1 wound = speed ×½ | 2 wounds = speed 0, -2 DEX
ANY (Hasso, Waki): Attacker chooses zone

PROGRESSION: First hit = 1 wound. Second hit same zone = 2 wounds (crippled).
Track: HEAD ○○ | TORSO ○○ | LEGS ○○
WOUND LIMIT: 6 total wounds = defeated.

RECOVERY (combat): Spend action + DC 12 CON save → remove 1 wound (once/zone/fight)

DEFEAT: 0 HP OR 6 wounds = defeated (whichever first). Finishers require target standing (HP>0).
HP + ZONES: Damage reduces HP. Zone wounds are additional penalties. Both tracked separately.
```

---

## TACTICAL NOTES

| Stance | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Jodan** | Finishing, aggression, high risk/reward |
| **Chudan** | Uncertainty, no weaknesses |
| **Gedan** | Counterattacking, crippling mobility |
| **Hasso** | Survival, recovery, reading enemy |
| **Waki** | Opening combat, information advantage |

---

## NPC DUELIST PATTERNS

```
=== DUELIST: [Name] ===
Prefers: [stance]

===
```

**Examples:**

| **Reader** | Waki → adapt | Read success → counter-stance |
| **Master** | Unpredictable | High WIS, reads player |

---

## DUELS AND HONOR

### Challenge Rules
- Honor 7+ can challenge equal or lower status
- Refusing challenge = -1 honor (not -2)

- Limit: 1 formal challenge per target per month

### Duel Protocol
- Melee weapons only
- One on one

| Spare defeated | +1 (enemy owes debt) |

---

## OPTIONAL RULES

### Finishers

### Disarming
From Gedan: on crit.success can disarm instead of damage. Unarmed = surrender or huge disadvantage.

---

## FIREARMS (Teppō)

```
By Sengoku standards, firearms are legitimate military tools.
Ashigaru with tanegashima won Nagashino (1575).
This is not Edo-period romanticization.

IN WAR/BATTLE: No honor penalty. Guns are tools of war.

IN FORMAL DUELS:
Firearms are MECHANICALLY INAPPROPRIATE for testing martial skill,
not morally inferior. The stance system tests mastery; guns bypass it.

RESTRICTIONS:

1. ONE SHOT RULE
   - May fire ONE shot before/during duel
   - Reload takes 3 full rounds (no other actions)
   - After shot: fight with sword or tantō

2. MISFIRE
   - Natural 1-2 on attack = misfire
   - In rain/wet: natural 1-4 = misfire
   - Misfired weapon = club until cleaned (short rest)

3. NO FINISHING BLOW
   - Firearms inflict max 2 zone wounds per hit
   - Duel cannot END on gunshot alone
   - Sword must deliver the finishing blow

4. WAKI RUSH (Counter-play)
   - Duelist in Waki may use reaction to RUSH firearm draw
   - Contested DEX check
   - Win: close to melee before shot fires
   - Lose: shot lands, but you close to melee after

5. REPUTATION COST
   - Using firearm AND winning by gun alone: -1 honor
   - Fire, then win by sword: NO honor loss
   - ("He couldn't win with skill alone" vs "He seized advantage and proved mastery")

SUMMARY:
| Context                        | Honor | Stance System? |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| War/Battle                     | 0     | No (base combat) |
| Ambush                         | 0     | No |
| Duel: gun opener → sword win   | 0     | Yes |
| Duel: relies on gun to win     | -1    | Partial |
| Assassination                  | 0     | No (murder rules apply) |
```

# THE WITCHER

Monster hunters in a dying age. Based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books + CDPR games expansion.

**Era:** 1200s-1268 (Conjunction aftermath to Northern Wars)
**Players:** Witchers only
**Tone:** Grim, morally grey, "lesser evil" dilemmas
**Focus:** 70% monster hunting, 30% politics
**System:** Uses gm-skill.md base rules (d20, attributes, DCs)

> **Book vs Game Content:** Wolf and Cat schools are book-canon. Griffin, Bear, Viper, Manticore are CDPR game additions. Some monsters (nekkers, foglets, rotfiends) and the decoction system are game-derived. All content is playable — this note is for lore purists.

## SETTING OVERVIEW

### The Conjunction of the Spheres

1500 years ago, the Conjunction merged worlds — monsters, elves, and humans collided. Humans won through numbers and breeding. Elves retreated. Monsters remained.

**The Witcher Solution:** Mages created mutant hunters. Trial of Grasses killed 7 of 10 boys but produced superhuman slayers. For centuries, witchers kept the balance.

**The Decline:** By 1260s, monsters grow rare. Peasants who once begged for witchers now throw stones. The schools crumble. Kaer Morhen holds perhaps 5 living Wolf witchers. The profession dies with its last practitioners.

### Themes

- **Neutrality vs. Involvement** — Witchers claim no politics, but contracts drag them in
- **Lesser Evil** — No good choices, only degrees of harm
- **Humanity of Monsters** — Some "monsters" more human than humans
- **Extinction** — Both witchers and many monster species face oblivion
- **Prejudice** — Mutants hated by those they protect

---

## GEOGRAPHY

### The Continent

**Northern Kingdoms** — Fragmented human realms. Cold winters, dense forests, superstitious peasants. Most contracts here.

**Nilfgaard** — Southern empire. Warmer, wealthier, more "civilized." Monsters rare near cities, common in provinces.

**Skellige** — Island nation. Viking culture. Sea monsters, ice giants, and drowners aplenty.

**Zerrikania** — Far east. Exotic, dragons rumored friendly. Manticore school territory.

### Monster Hotspots

| Region | Common Monsters | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Velen (No Man's Land)** | Drowners, rotfiends, foglets, grave hags | War-torn, corpses everywhere |
| **Novigrad Area** | Wraiths, ghouls, bandits | Urban edge, cemeteries, docks |
| **Skellige Isles** | Sirens, drowners, ice trolls, wraiths | Coastal, caves, cold |
| **Kaedwen Wilderness** | Leshens, fiends, wolves, nekkers | Deep forest, Kaer Morhen region |
| **Nilfgaardian Provinces** | Varies by terrain | Less frequent but harder contracts |
| **Swamps (Any)** | Drowners, water hags, kikimores | Persistent problem everywhere |
| **Mountains** | Griffins, trolls, harpies, rock elementals | Height and cold complications |
| **Battlefields** | Ghouls, alghouls, rotfiends, specters | Post-war cleanup contracts |

### Key Locations

**Kaer Morhen** — Wolf school fortress. Hidden valley in Blue Mountains (Kaedwen). Winter training grounds. Nearly abandoned. Only place Trial of Grasses can still be performed.

**Oxenfurt** — University city. Scholars, mages, information. Good place to research rare monsters.

**Vizima** — Temerian capital. Foltest's court. Urban contracts, political complications.

**Novigrad** — Free city. Trade hub. Temple of Eternal Fire (witch hunters). Dangerous for magic users.

**Cintra** — Nilfgaardian occupied. War refugees. Lots of undead from massacres.

**Brokilon** — Dryad forest. Hostile to outsiders. Ancient relicts. Do not enter without invitation.
